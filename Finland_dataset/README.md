This directory contains the following files:

(1) "Finland_CC_times.txt" 

(2) "Finland_events_GT.txt"

(3) "Finland_phaselist.txt"

(4) "calculate_Finland_theoretical_slovecs.sh"

and, just as a check,

(5) "Finland_ak135_slovecs_expected.txt"

After cloning VIScERaL, you should be able to go to the directory Finland_dataset
and generate the file "Finland_ak135_slovecs.txt" by running the script
calculate_Finland_theoretical_slovecs.sh.

The generated file should be (almost) identical to Finland_ak135_slovecs_expected.txt.

Please refer to Gibbons et al. (2020) for a description of the test case and please refer to Kennett et al. (1995) for a description of the ak135 seismic velocity model.
