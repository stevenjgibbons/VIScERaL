This directory contains the following files:

(1) **locate_one_event.sh**  

This script solves for the location of one of the events DPRK1, DPRK3, DPRK4, or DPRK5
relative to the fixed DPRK2.

(2) **DPRK_events.txt**  

A list of the first 5 North Korean nuclear explosions, labelled DPRK1, DPRK2, DPRK3, DPRK4, and DPRK5 - all fixed to the same location.
This file is essentially just a help for the locate_one_event.sh script. We could have written the script differently to avoid needing this file.
