(1) **solve_for_slowness_with_fixed_locs_DPRK.sh**  

We take a set of fixed event location estimates and solve for the set of slowness vectors which best
satisfies the set of relative time delays.  

(2) **rellocs_vs_DPRK2_fromex1_fixed.txt**  

The relative locations of events DPRK1, DPRK2, DPRK3, DPRK4, and DPRK5 obtained in exercise 1. 
Note that the flags are all set to F such that the program does not attempt to move them.  

(3) **slovecs_flags_solve.txt**  

The same set of predicted AK135 slowness vectors but this time given the flag "S" so that the program tries
to solve for their optimal values.
