This directory contains the following files:  

(1) **rellocs_vs_DPRK2_fromex1.txt**  

These are the solutions that were obtained in DPRK_exercise1, locating the events one by one relative to DPRK2.  

(2) **locate_all_vs_all_fixedslovecs_from_ex1.sh**  

A script which solve all events relative to DPRK2 simultaneously using all of the appropriate measurements
and fixed slowness vectors specified by the ak135 model. It takes as the starting point the file rellocs_vs_DPRK2_fromex1.txt.  

(3) **locate_all_vs_all_fixedslovecs_from_Yang.sh**  

Exactly the same as locate_all_vs_all_fixedslovecs_from_ex1.sh except that it takes as the initial conditions the solutions
published by Yang et al. (2021).
